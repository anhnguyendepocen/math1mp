**DRAFT NOTES**

I went to a mathematics talk yesterday that talked in passing about *graph colouring*, which is the same topic I mentioned (very briefly!) during the first class.

* Wikipedia on [graph colouring](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring)
* define *chromatic number*
* discuss [Sage graph colouring algorithms](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/graphs/sage/graphs/graph_coloring.html))
* four-colour theorem specifically applies to graphs that can be generated by translating partitions of the plane into neighbour graphs (i.e. each region is a vertex, each edge represents a pair of neighbours)
* applications (among others) in scheduling -- if classes are vertices and
edges represent classes with students in common, then you need a number of 
time slots equal to the chromatic number in order to allow everyone to fill their schedules without conflicts (unless you have [better technology](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Time-Turner))
* what can we find out about some interesting graphs (e.g.co-authorship on MathSciNet or ArXiv?  Can we make up some graphs about the class?)  Graph coloring is a difficult problem, so doing it for big graphs might be tough (I don't know what impractically big corresponds to -- 100? 1000? 10,000?)
