## Installing Python

* Everyone must have access to a computer with Python3 installed
    * There are detailed instructions for installing Python3 on the 
[Pragmatic Programming](https://pragprog.com/book/gwpy2/practical-programming) website.
        * Click on the 'Details' tab and scroll to the appropriate instructions for your operating system.
        * On Mac and Linux, once Python3 is installed you can run it directly from the Terminal by typing python3. On Windows, go to the Start menu and find Python.
* We are recommending that you use PyCharm to write your programs and test things out.
    * You can find the PyCharm installer [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/). **The first time you run PyCharm, make sure you choose python 3.4.2 from the drop-down menu**

# More interesting stuff

## Using computers in math and science

* math users vs. understanders vs. developers
* develop conjectures; draw pictures; write manuscripts
* mathematical proof (e.g. [four-colo(u)r theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem) and [other examples](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1084230/what-are-some-theorems-that-currently-only-have-computer-assisted-proofs)); computer algebra
* applied math: cryptography, tomography, logistics, finance, fluid dynamics, ...
* applied statistics: bioinformatics, Big Data/analytics, ...
* discrete vs. continuous

## Fun!

**Hello, world**

```{r opts,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
library("knitr")
opts_chunk$set(tidy=FALSE,engine='python')
```

```{r hello_world}
print('hello, python world!')
```

Python as a fancy calculator:
```{r calc}
print(62**2*27/5+3)
```

## Interlude: about Python

* [programming languages](http://crashworks.org/if_programming_languages_were_vehicles/)
    * Python: [scripting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language); high-level; glue; general-purpose; flexible
    * contrast: *domain-specific* scripting languages (MATLAB, R, Mathematica, Maple)
	* contrast: *general-purpose* scripting languages (Perl, PHP)
	* contrast: general-purpose *compiled* languages (Java, C, C++) ("close to the metal")
* relatively modern (1990s; Python 3, 2008)
* currently the [8th most popular computer language](http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html) overall; [most popular for teaching](http://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/176450-python-is-now-the-most-popular-introductory-teaching-language-at-top-us-universities/fulltext)
* well suited to mathematical and scientific programming ([NumPy](http://www.numpy.org); [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org))
* ex.: [Sage](http://www.sagemath.org); [BioPython](http://www.biopython.org)

**the Mandelbrot set**

Suppose we iterate $z_{n+1}=z_{n}^2+c$, for some complex number $c$, starting with $z_0=0$.
The [Mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) is the set for which the iterations do *not* go off to infinity. (*What happens for $c=0$? $c=-1$? $c=i$? $c=1$?*)

We can iterate by hand ...
```{r mandel1}
print(complex(0,0.65)**2+complex(0,0.65))
print((complex(0,0.65)**2+complex(0,0.65))**2+complex(0,0.65))
print(((complex(0,0.65)**2+complex(0,0.65))**2+complex(0,0.65))**2)+complex(0,0.65)
```

Use **assignments** to simplify ...
```{r julia2}
z0=0
c=complex(0,0.65)
z1=z0**2+c
z2=z1**2+c
z3=z2**2+c
print(abs(z3)<2)
```

The basic method for generating pretty pictures is:

* for lots of different values of $c$
    * set $z_0=0$
    * keep calculating $z_{n+1}=z_n^2+c$ until $\textrm{mod}(z_{n+1})$ is greater than 2
	* record the final value of $n$
* translate values of $n$ into some colour scale and plot the results	

Complex arithmetic is built into Python    
(*What is $(2+3i)^2$=*`(complex(2,3))**2`?)

[Mandelbrot set program](../code/mandelbrot.py)

**Note**:

* easier to understand/modify than write from scratch
* build on existing components (*modules*)

## Interfaces

* command line/console (PyCharm: `View/Tool Windows/Python Console`)
* programming editor
* integrated development environment (IDE)
* **not** MS Word! ![skull](pix/skullcross_tiny.png)

**Features**

* syntax highlighting
* bracket-matching
* hot-pasting
* integrated help
* integrated debugging tools
* integrated project management tools

* **most important**: maintain reproducibility; well-defined **workflows**

# Assignment

* superficially simple
    * `=` is the **assignment operator** 
	* `<variable>=<value>`
	* variable names
         * what is legal? (letters, numbers, underscores, start with a letter)
	     * what is customary? [convention](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#id30) is `variables_like_this`
	     * what works well? `v` vs. `temporary_variable_for_loop`
		 * parallels with file names; directory/folder organization
* variables can be of different [**types**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html)
     * built-in: integer (`int`), floating-point (`float`), complex, **Boolean** (`bool`: `True` or `False`),
     * *dynamic* typing
	 * (relatively) *strong* typing
         * try `print(type(x))` for different possibilities (`x=3`; `x=3.0`; `x="a"`)
		 * *what happens if you try `x=a`?*
		 * **don't be afraid to experiment!**
```{r eval=FALSE}
x=3
y=3.0
z="a"
q=complex(1,2)
type(x+y)  ## mixed arithmetic
type(int(x+y))  ## int(), float() convert explicitly
type(x+z)
type(q)
type(x+q)
type(True)
type(True+1) ## WAT
```

## Comparisons and logical expressions

* comparison: (`==`, `!=`)
* inequalities: `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, 
* basic logic: (`and`, `or`, `not`)
* remember your truth tables, e.g. `not(a and b)` equals `(not a) or (not b)`

```{r logical,eval=FALSE}
a = True; b = False; c=1; d=0
a and b
not(a and not b)
a and not(b>c)
a==c  ## careful!
not(d)
not(c)
```

From [CodingBat](http://codingbat.com/prob/p120546):

We have two monkeys, a and b, and the parameters `a_smile` and `b_smile` indicate if each is smiling. We are in trouble if they are both smiling or if neither of them is smiling. Return `True` if we are in trouble. 

```
monkey_trouble(True, True) → True
monkey_trouble(False, False) → True
monkey_trouble(True, False) → False
```

* **operator precedence**: same issue as [order of operations in arithmetic](http://xkcd.com/992/); `not` has higher precedence than `and`, `or`.  When in doubt use parentheses ...

## String operations

*reference*: [Python intro](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html) section 3.1.2

* Less generally important, but fun
* `+` concatenates
* `*` replicates and concatenates
* `in` searches for a substring
```{r strops,eval=FALSE}
a = "xyz"
b = "abc"
a+1  ## error
a+b
b*3
(a+" ")*5
b in a
```

From [CodingBat](http://codingbat.com/prob/p182144):

> Given two strings, a and b, return the result of putting them together in the order abba, e.g. "Hi" and "Bye" returns "HiByeByeHi". 

## Regular expressions

Large topic -- somewhat more advanced than 'basic programming', but worth a digression.

What if we are looking for some number, but we don't know what number?
```{r re}
import re
bool(re.search('[0-9]', 'Plan 9'))
```

----------------------------------------------------------
   Pattern   Description                                           
-----------  ---------------------------------------------
 `^`         Beginning of line
 
 `$`	     End of line    
 
 `.`         Any single character except newline
 
 `[...]`	 Any single character in brackets         
 
 `[^...]`	 Any single character **not** in brackets 
 
 `re*`	     0 or more occurrences of preceding expression
 
 `re+`	     1 or more occurrence of preceding expression
 
 `re?`	     0 or 1 occurrence of preceding expression  
 
 `re1|re2`   match `re1` or `re2`
 
 `()`        grouping
 
----------------------------------------------------------

* How would you test whether a string contains a numeric value at the end (e.g. "Plan 99")?
* What if the string might contain a comma (e.g. "Plan 99,478")?
* What if you're looking for the abbreviations of rooms in Hamilton Hall (my office is HH314)?
* ... rooms in LSB *or* HH?

# Lists and indexing

*reference*: [Python intro](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html) section 3.1.3

## Lists

* Use square brackets `[]` to set up a **list**
* Lists can contain anything but usually homogeneous
* Put other variables into lists
* Put lists into lists!
* `range()` makes a **range** but you can turn it into a list with `list()`

* *Make a list that runs from 101 to 200*
* *Make a list that  ... *

## Indexing and slicing

**Indexing**

* Extracting elements is called **indexing** a list
* Indexing [starts from zero](http://xkcd.com/163/)
* Negative indices count backward from the end of the string   
(-1 is the last element)
* Indexing a non-existent element gives an error

![slicing](pix/string-slicing.png)

**Slicing**

* Extracting sets of elements is called [**slicing**](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/509211/explain-pythons-slice-notation)
* Slicing non-existent element(s) gives a truncated result
* Slicing specifies *start*, *end*, *step* (or "stride")
* Leaving out a bit goes from the beginning/to the end
* Slicing works on strings too!

```{r slice_ex,eval=FALSE}
x[:]        # everything
x[a:b]      # element a (zero-indexed) to b-1
x[a:]       # a to end
x[:b]       # beginning to b
x[a:b:n]    # from a to b-1 in steps of n
```

* generate list of odd numbers from 3 to 15
* reverse a string?

**Other list operations**

* Lots of things you can do with lists!
* Distinguish between *copying* lists and modifying them in-place
* Distinguish between *functions* and *methods* `foo(x)` vs. `x.foo()`
    * appending:
    * list [*methods*](http://www.linuxtopia.org/online_books/programming_books/python_programming/python_ch14s07.html)
    * appending and extending:
```{r append}
x = [1,2,3]
y = [4,5]
x.append(y)
print(x)
```
```{r extend}
x = [1,2,3] # reset x
y = [4,5]
x.extend(y)
print(x)
```
Can use `+` as a shortcut for extending:
```{r operate}
x = [1,2,3]
y = [4,5]
z = x+y
print(z)
```

* `x.insert(position,value)`: inserts 
* `x.remove(value)`:
* `x.pop(position)` (or `del x[position]` or `x[position]=[]`)
* `x.reverse()` (or `x[::-1]`)
* `x.sort()`: what it says
* `x.count(value)`: number of occurrences of `value`
* `x.index(value)`: first occurrence of `value` 
* `value in x`: does `value` occur in `x`? (or `logical(x.count(value)==0)`)
* `len(x)`: length
