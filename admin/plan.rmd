## MATH 1MP, Introduction to mathematical/scientific programming

Revision: `r as.character(Sys.time())`

This is an *approximate* and *preliminary* schedule for the course.  It is guaranteed to change.

See http://bbolker.github.io/math1mp/ for lecture notes, assignments, etc..

## week 1: basics

* T Jan 5  introduction to the course; introduction to [Python](http://xkcd.com/353/); editors and workflows
* R Jan 7  data types; logical operations; string operations; regular expressions

<!-- editors (xkcd butterfly?) -->
<!-- variable naming and conventions; http://www.gps.alaska.edu/jeff/Classes/GEOS436+636/02_fundamentals.pdf; **assignment**: set up Python and write a couple of trivial programmes -->
