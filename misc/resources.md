Resources
=========

This is a general list of interesting and/or useful Python materials. If you find useful stuff that isn't on the list, please suggest it to the instructor or the TA ...

## Books, tutorials, etc.

There is no required textbook for this course, but these resources may be useful.

* [Practical Programming](https://pragprog.com/book/gwpy2/practical-programming) by Paul Gries, Jennifer Campbell, and Jason Montojo is a relatively inexpensive option for an introductory textbook.
* The official Python3 documentation at [python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/) is the most comprehensive option for everything that is part of the Python3 programming language
	* These can get a little technical, but they are the final word on what any function or class does
* [Python for Beginners](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/) from the Python Software Foundation

## Other tools

* Typing `help("topic")` in Python will give you information about any Python function, class, etc..  Unfortunately you have to know what to ask: for example, `help("power")` doesn't work but `help("pow")` does (because the Python function for raising a number to a power is `pow()`, not `power()`).
* [This](http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit) is a neat little tool that shows you what all your variables are doing as you move through a Python program. Be sure to choose Python 3 from the drop-down menu!

## Forums

* Probably best to ask Python questions first on the Avenue to Learn forums
* [StackOverflow "python"-tagged questions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python) are a very good resource for *looking for answers* (However, I suggest that you **do not** ask questions there until you have (1) tried to get the answer locally [from me or the TA or a fellow student] and (2) read and absorbed the [advice on how to ask questions](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask).)
