## Assignment 1

Your first assignment is to work through two sections of the problems on [CodingBat](http://codingbat.com): [Warmup-1](http://codingbat.com/python/Warmup-1) and [Logic-1](http://codingbat.com/python/Logic-1).

You should answer all of the problems in these sections by **midnight on Weds. 14 January** (you don't need to hand anything in, just follow the instructions below and solve the problems on the CodingBat web site). If you have any trouble following the setup instructions, please post a question in the relevant discussion forum on Avenue (the sooner the better).

### Setup

If you do not follow these instructions you will not get credit for the
homework.

* go to the [CodingBat](http://codingbat.com) web site.
* [create an account](http://codingbat.com/pref?docreate=1) (this link, or in the upper right hand corner of the CodingBat page)
    * **you MUST use your McMaster e-mail as the account id**
	* please enter your name (Last name, First name)
* go back to the CodingBat web page and log in (if necessary)
* go the the [preferences](http://codingbat.com/pref) link and enter `teaching@jcszamosi.ca` in the `Share To` box; click `Share`

### Answering problems

* go to the [Python section of CodingBat](http://codingbat.com/python), or directly to [Warmup-1](http://codingbat.com/python/Warmup-1) or [Logic-1](http://codingbat.com/python/Logic-1).
* Click on a problem you want to work on.
* In the problem box you will see something like
```
def sleep_in(weekday, vacation):
```
**Don't modify this line**.  This line tells you the names of the variables you will be working with (in this case `weekday` and `vacation`). Their meanings will be explained in the problem statement.
* **Your solution must be indented with spaces under the first line.**
* **Your solution must end with a `return(...)` statement that provides your answer** (fill in the variable containing your answer in place of `...`)
* Once you think you have written your program (including `return(...)`), click on the `Go` button to test your program.  You will see a variety of tests on the right-hand side, and the computer will tell you which of them your program ran successfully.
* Keep working until you pass all the tests.

### Tips

* We will only see how many of the problems in a section you've completely solved, so there won't be any partial credit.
* If you forget to fill in the `Share To` box, we won't see your answers at all.
* CodingBat actually uses Python 2, not Python 3 (this should only make a difference if you try to compute `x/y` where both `x` and `y` are integers).
* It can be useful to run snippets in the Python console if you're trying to figure out what a piece of your program does (e.g., if you can't remember what `x[2:3]` does, try running `x="something"; print(x[2:3])` in the Python console).
* The following problems *only* require you to know about logical and arithmetic operators: 
    * Warmup-1: `sleep_in`, `monkey_trouble`, `near_hundred`, `parrot_trouble`, `pos_neg`, `makes10`
	* Logic-1: `cigar_party`, `love6`, `near_ten`
* The following problems require you to know about string slicing:
    * Warmup-1: `missing_char`, `front_back`, `front3`
* The following problems require you to know about `if:/else:`:
    * Warmup-1: `diff21`, `sum_double`, `not_string`, `caught_speeding`, `date_fashion`, `sorta_sum`, `in1to10`, `squirrel_play`, `alarm_clock`, `near_ten`
