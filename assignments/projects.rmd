These projects are **individual** projects; if you discuss anything about them with other students in the class, you should follow the standard rules (don't write anything down while you are engaged with the other students).  If you get anything from the web, give references.

Choose **one** of the two projects below. If you have your own idea for a different project, please send me an e-mail with a 1-paragraph description *before Fri 17 March*; I will review it and let you know if it's suitable.

Depending on which project you pick, submit your code in the Dropbox as `macid_proj_wipeaway.py` and your plot as `macid_proj_wipeaway.png`, or your code as `macid_proj_cipher.py` and your project as `macid_proj_cipher.png`.

We do **not** want to have to run your simulation and plotting code when we import your Python file. Include it in your Python file in **one** of the following ways:

- commented out
- within an `if False:` block
- within an `if __name__ == "__main__":` block


### Wipeaway (dice game)

Consider the following stochastic process:

- set a counter to a starting value (`N`: let the default value be 20)
- at each turn:
    - roll a die with `D` sides: suppose the result is `c`
	- flip a coin: if it's heads (with probability $p$), try to add `c` to the counter, otherwise (with probability $1-p$) try to subtract `c` from the counter
	- if the result of adding or subtracting `c` would be $>N$ or $<0$, ignore the roll and try again
	- if the result of subtracting `c` would be exactly zero, stop (you've won the game)

1. Write a function `run_sim(N=20,D=6,p=0.5,itmax=5000)` that runs a single simulation with the specified parameters and returns an integer giving the number of steps it took to reach zero. You can assume that `N` and `D` are non-zero integers, and `p` is a float between 0 and 1. If the count goes above `itmax` your function should raise a `RuntimeError`.

2. Write a function `collect_sims(nsim,N,D,p=0.5,nmax=10000)` that runs your `run_sim` function `nsim` times (with parameters `N`, `D`, `p`) and returns a numpy array of length `nmax` giving the number of times that the simulation took a specified number of steps to stop. For example, if `nsim` was 3 and the simulation stopped once after 3 steps and twice after 5 steps, the returned array would be `[0 0 0 1 0 2 0 ....]`.

3. Write a function `exp_val(a)` that takes an array and computes the expected value from it: the expected value is defined as $\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i a_i)/N$, where $n$ is the length of the array and $N$ is the number of simulations (also equal to $\sum_i a_i$).

4. Write a function `many_sims(N_vals,D_vals,p,nsim=100)`: `N_vals` and `D_vals` are 2-element tuples. The function should run your simulation `nsim` times for each combination of `N` values between `N_vals[0]` and `N_vals[1]` **inclusive** and `D` values between `D_vals[0]` and `D_vals[1]` **inclusive**; for each parameter set it should  For example, if `N_vals` is `(19,20)` and `D_vals` is `(5,)`, your results might be
```{r echo=FALSE}
import numpy as np
np.array([[210.1],[237.2]])
```
5. Write a function `plot_results(N_vals,D_vals,a)` (where `N_vals` and `D_vals` are as described above, and `a` is the result of running `many_sims` that makes a single plot with values of `N` on the x-axis, the expected values on the y-axis, and a separate line (or point colour or something) for each value of `D`


(Add plot example)

### Substitution ciphers

A *substitution cipher* is the simplest way of encrypting a message. It is constructed by defining a permutation on the letters of the alphabet, and substituting accordingly. For example, suppose we had the following permutation:
```
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
gikaclmnqrpoxzybdefijstuvw
```
Then the message `"hello"` would translate to `"ncooy"`, and `"goodbye"` would translate to `"myyaivc"`.

For the purposes of this project, assume that all messages are entirely composed of lower case letters and spaces; spaces should be translated exactly is.  For example, using the previously defined cipher we would translate `"hello goodbye"` as `"ncooy myyaivc"`.

1. Write a function `sub_cipher(msg,d)` that takes a message string `msg` and a dictionary `d` where the keys are letters to translate *from* and the values are the letters to translate *to*, and returns a translated copy of the message.

2. Write a function `reverse_dict(d)` that switches the identities of the values and keys of a dictionary. Convince yourself that the code

```{r sub_cipher,eval=FALSE}
trans = sub_cipher(msg,d)
orig = sub_cipher(trans,reverse_dict(d))
orig == trans
```
always returns `True` (computer programmers sometimes call this kind of test [round-tripping](http://www.yourdictionary.com/round-tripping)).

3. Write a function `read_cipherdef(fn)` that opens a file (specified by filename `fn`) containing two lines, the first with the string giving the keys and the second with the string giving the values (as in the example above), and returns a dictionary.

4. A *crib* is a string that is known to be part of the original plaintext (i.e., the message that was translated). The *Hamming distance* between two (equal-length) strings is the number of mismatches between them (for example, the Hamming distance between `hello` and `iejlo` is 2). Write a function `min_crib_dist(crib,msg)`, where `crib` and `msg` are two strings (with `len(crib) <= len(msg)`), that returns the *minimum* Hamming distance between the crib and any substring of `msg`. In other words, your function needs to test all consecutive substrings of length `len(crib)` in the message and find the minimum Hamming distance.  For example `min_crib_dist("hello","this message almost contains hellx")` should return 1 because the string `"hellx"` has a Hamming distance of 1 from `"hello"`.

5. Write a function `rand_dict(keys=ascii_lowercase)` (`ascii_lowercase` is a constant from the `string` module; your code should include `from string import ascii_lowercase` that returns a dictionary with the letters of `keys` as keys and a permutation of the letters of `keys` as values. You can use `np.array(list(keys))` to create an array that contains the letters of `keys`, and the `shuffle` function from `numpy.random` to shuffle an array in place.

6. Write code that reads the contents of the test file `test1T.txt` as a variable `t1T` and records the minimum Hamming distance between the crib `"squeamish ossifrage"` and the translation of `t1T` with a random dictionary (i.e. `min_crib_dist("squeamish ossifrage",sub_cipher(t1T,rand_dict()))`) for 10,000 random dictionaries. Use `matplot.pyplot.hist` to draw a histogram of the results.
